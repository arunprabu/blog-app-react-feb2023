1. Try exploring useState hook with object and nested object being default value.
  example
  ---------
    useState({
      name: 'John',
      age: 20,
      role: 'student',
      address: {
        city: 'London'
      }
    })

    have two buttons  in JSX with proper event handlers
      [Change Age] 
      [Change City]

    try updating age and city
