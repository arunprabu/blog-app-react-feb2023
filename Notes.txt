// Fn components
  1. Fn Comp with Named Fn [DONE]
  2. Fn Comp with Anonymous Fn [DONE]
  3. Fn Comp with Arrow Fn 

  * were called as dumb / presentational / stateless components before v16.8 of React 
  * after v16.8 of React, no longer stateless 
  * hooks facilitate loads of missed features 
  * have state and other React features without writing a class component.

// Class Components 
  * called as containers, stateful, smart components

    Prepare Test Cases for Add Feature
    ==================
      1. input should be of numbers
      2. output should be of number as well
      3. if other than numbers entered add button should be disabled 

    Add Feature
    ---
      function add(a, b) {
        if(typeof a === 'number' && typeof b === 'number'){
          return a + b;
        }
      }
      add(10, 20); // 30

    To Test use Tools
    ----
      * to test our functional code against the identified test cases 
      * if bugs the tools will throw error immediately
      * if success the tools will give a green signal

Modern Software Dev approach

  devs write test cases => devs write fn code => (Tools) => SUCCESS / FAILURE
